The Space Coast Unmanned (SCU) Cerberus is a multispectral detection system designed for use in the Force Protection Kit challenge. SCU is pleased to offer a fully compliant solution that covers seismic, acoustic, magnetic, infrared, radiofrequency(RF), and visible light anomaly detection in an extremely low cost package. Telemetry including battery voltage and tamper detection is provided via LoRa long range radio units with an advertised range of 1.25 miles (2km) line of sight. The transmission is protected by AES128 encryption to prevent interception of data. The radio units can be configured to transmit periodically, or only upon anomaly detection to prevent detection of the sensor system.  All hardware used inside the unit is openly available online, and open source or GPL software was used to minimize unique software. Adaptations specific to the unit such as wiring and code changes were unavoidable but kept to a minimum to allow easy reproduction or future functionality upgrades. The unit draws only 4 Watts of power, allowing long runtimes. The current enclosure is rated to IP55 ingress protection standards. The unit is compact and lightweight with a carrying handle, allowing easy transport by a single individual. Deployment of the sensor can be completed by one person in less than one minute for maximum versatility. Addresses from 0-255 are available, meaning a single receiving station can uniquely identify multiple sensors simultaneously.
